Introduction
Motivation
    Highly-available / safety-critical systems can benefit from distribution
        exp. RIAPS uses DHTs for service registration
    Malicious actors could mess with current systems TODO: check popular current systems
    Handling malicious actors in distributed systems is currently done with blockchain - TODO: check literature
        blockchain isn't great for all applications
            complete ledger is wasteful
            complete transaction isn't atomic
    Merging PBFT and DHTs can provide best of both worlds
About BFDHT
    Basic stuff, replication, Kademlia
    Transaction scheme
